 * This function simulates the function exec()
 * An execute function in a terminal typically refers to the ability to run commands or programs directly from the command line interface.
 * In Unix-based systems, this is commonly accomplished using the exec() family of functions, which are used to replace the current process image with a 
 * new process image. These functions are typically used in conjunction with the fork() system call to create a new process, which can then be replaced with a new program using the exec() functions.
 * The exec() functions take the name of the program to be executed, as well as any command-line arguments that should be passed to the program. 
 * Once the exec() function is called, the current process image is replaced with the new program, which begins executing from the beginning of its main() function.
 * Overall, the ability to execute commands and programs directly from the terminal is a powerful feature of Unix-based systems that allows for efficient and flexible interaction with the operating system and other programs.

        In C, dup(DuplicateFD) is a system call that duplicates the file descriptor specified by DuplicateFD, and returns a new file descriptor that is the lowest numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.
        The new file descriptor returned by dup() points to the same open file description as the file descriptor specified by DuplicateFD. This means that any operations performed on the new file descriptor will affect the same file as the original file descriptor.

        In C, when piping is used, it is important to close the file descriptors that are no longer needed to prevent potential issues such as deadlocks or resource leaks.
        In particular, after the dup2() function is used to redirect the output of one process to the input of another process, it is important to close the write end of the pipe (i.e. pipeFD[1]) in the parent process. This is because the parent process no longer needs to write to the pipe, and keeping the write end open can cause problems, such as the child process blocking indefinitely on a read call waiting for data that will never come.
        Closing the write end of the pipe in the parent process (close(pipeFD[1])) ensures that the child process will eventually receive an end-of-file indication when it attempts to read from the pipe, allowing it to gracefully exit once it has processed all of the data.
        In summary, closing the write end of the pipe after the dup2() function is used helps prevent issues such as deadlocks, resource leaks, and other unintended behavior that can occur when file descriptors are not properly managed in a multi-process environment.

This helps prevent issues such as resource leaks and other unintended behavior that can occur when processes are not properly managed in a multi-process environment.
    
        In C, wait(NULL) is a system call that suspends the execution of the calling process until one of its child processes terminates. When a child process terminates, its exit status is collected by the parent process using the wait() system call.
        The wait(NULL) system call is used when the parent process does not need to know the specific exit status of the child process. When wait(NULL) is called, the parent process will block until any child process terminates, and the exit status of the child process is discarded.
