# Introduction:
The main goal of this assignment is to create a shell.

# Explanation of the codes found in the project:

In the assignment folder we received there were three files for the shell program:  
•shell1.c -prints a cursor and runs commands with arguments.  
•shell2.c – adds routing to the file.  
•shell3.c pipe adds   
•key.c  

The codes I wrote to accomplish the task:
**linkedlist.h and linkedlist.c** 

creating a library for creating variables:
*Var* - is designed to save new variables like in the real shell with key and value  
*Node*- to create a variable of a doubly linked list with next and prv, in addition it has a data variable.  
*List*- creating a doubly linked list whose fields are data and head, tail.  



```ECHO <message>```
In C, the hyphen (-) is a common operator used for subtraction, and it can also be used to negate a value.

The en-dash (–) is a character that is not used as an operator in C. In fact, the en

dash is not even included in the ASCII character set, which is a set of characters commonly used in C programming. Instead, the ASCII hyphen character (-) is used for all subtraction and negation operations in C.

It's important to use the correct character when writing code in C, as using the wrong character can result in syntax errors or unexpected behavior.
