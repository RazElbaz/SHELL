```ECHO <message>```
In C, the hyphen (-) is a common operator used for subtraction, and it can also be used to negate a value.

The en-dash (–) is a character that is not used as an operator in C. In fact, the en-dash is not even included in the ASCII character set, which is a set of characters commonly used in C programming. Instead, the ASCII hyphen character (-) is used for all subtraction and negation operations in C.

It's important to use the correct character when writing code in C, as using the wrong character can result in syntax errors or unexpected behavior.
